# OOP

This is my Python Object Oriented Programming portfolio. This repository includes codes, library requirements and videos of how each application/game works. That is why you don't need to install all the Python libraries that I used to develop these applications.

You will find the videos and codes in the same folder (master branch).



## 1. Geometry Game

  It is a simple game. Users try to guess randomly generated rectangle place and size by guessing coordinates and rectangle size. After guessing the program will draw rectangle and dot in the canvas. If you dot are inside the rectangle, you win the game otherwise you lose it.

## 2. Flatmates-Bill

  An app that gets as input amout of a bill for a practicular period 
and the days that each of the flatmates stayed in the house for that period
and returns how much each flatmates has to pay. It also generates a PDF report stating
the name of the flatmates and the period.

  
## 3. Project Math Painting

  An app that lets the user provide the start coordinates of geometrical shapes such as
squares and rectangles, their dimensions, and their colors, and the program produces an image file canvas with all
the geometrical shapes drawn in it.

## 4. Webcam Photo Sharer

An app that starts the computer webcam, lets the user capture a photo
and uploads the photo to the web and creates a sharable link.
