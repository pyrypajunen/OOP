# OOP

This is my Python Object Oriented Programming portfolio. This repository includes codes, library requirements and videos of how each application/game works. That is why you don't need to install all the Python libraries that I used to develop these applications.

You will find the videos and codes in the same folder (master branch).



## 1. Geometry Game

  It is a simple game. Users try to guess randomly generated rectangle place and size by guessing coordinates and rectangle size. After guessing the program will draw rectangle and dot in the canvas. If you dot are inside the rectangle, you win the game otherwise you lose it.
